Now care must be taken to tackle the cases where you can win by more number of blocks.
To handle such cases we need to add some utility to our heuristic
Let this utility be Y
We made a hit and trial for evaluating Y by playing with previous versions of our bot and with
other bots.
We gave Y different values when we move first and when we move second since you need to
play safe when you play second..

Bonus move is also considered. Whenever during search, if bot wins a block, if it is at
a max node, it consider its child node also as max nodes instead of min nodes.
Similarly, if bot wins a block at a min node, it consider its child nodes as a min nodes
instead of max nodes.
